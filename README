blahtexml: an extension of blahtex with XML processing in mind
Designed by Gilles Van Assche

Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex to allow it to process an entire
XML file, and to convert each blahtex equation in it into MathML equations.
Blahtexml is a source-level extension of blahtex, which means that anything
that works with blahtex also works with blahtexml.

Blahtexml requires Xerces-C 2.x or 3.0 to be installed. If you do not have
Xerces-C installed, you will not be able to build blahtexml (but you will
still be able to build and use blahtex of course).

Brief build instructions (more details in the manual): run one of

  make blahtexml-linux
  make blahtexml-mac

======================================

Note that the example files example*.xml, HTML+Blahtex.xml and HTML+MathML.xml are in the public domain.
